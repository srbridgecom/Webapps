<h1 class="western"><strong>The Evolution of Washington’s Birthday to Presidents’ Day</strong></h1>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Washington’s Birthday Becomes a National Holiday</strong></h3>
In 1879, lawmakers officially declared Washington’s Birthday a holiday, originally applying only to the District of Columbia. However, by 1885, the holiday was expanded to cover the entire United States, making it one of only five federally recognized bank holidays at the time—alongside Christmas Day, New Year's Day, Thanksgiving, and Independence Day.

Today, Washington’s Birthday is one of 11 federal holidays, joined by Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, and Veterans Day. On these days, federal employees, as well as workers in banks, schools, and postal services, typically receive the day off. Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ remain closed for trading.
<h3 class="western"><strong>The U.S. Senate’s Tradition of Honoring Washington</strong></h3>
Each year on February 22, the U.S. Senate continues to honor George Washington with a special tradition. According to Mount Vernon, Washington’s historic estate, a Senator reads Washington’s Farewell Address on the Senate floor. This practice, which began in 1896, serves as a reminder of Washington’s lasting influence, particularly among federal workers. As the Mount Vernon website notes, it commemorates "a man whose patriotic spirit still inspires us to this day, particularly federal workers who uphold what he helped create."
<h3 class="western"><strong>A Shift in the 1960s: The Uniform Monday Holiday Act</strong></h3>
For nearly a century, Washington’s Birthday remained unchanged, always observed on February 22. However, by the 1960s, lawmakers sought to modernize federal holidays. Representative Robert McClory of Illinois proposed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, a measure designed to shift certain holidays to Mondays in order to provide workers with more three-day weekends. This move aimed to reduce employee absenteeism and boost retail sales.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Washington’s Birthday Moves—and Other Holidays Follow</strong></h3>
In 1971, President Richard Nixon signed an executive order enforcing the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which took effect that same year. This law moved Washington’s Birthday from February 22 to the third Monday in February.

Other holidays affected by the act included:
<ul>
 	<li>Memorial Day: Shifted from May 30 to the last Monday in May.</li>
 	<li>Columbus Day: Officially established and set for the second Monday in October to commemorate Christopher Columbus’s landing in the Americas on October 12, 1492.
<ul>
 	<li>Some states and cities now observe Indigenous Peoples' Day instead, honoring Native American heritage. While President Biden formally recognized Indigenous Peoples’ Day in 2021, it is not yet a federal holiday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Veterans Day Moved—But Quickly Restored</strong></h3>
The Uniform Monday Holiday Act also altered Veterans Day, which had originally been established as Armistice Day in 1919 to mark the end of World War I. The holiday was renamed Veterans Day in 1954 to honor all U.S. military veterans. However, in 1971, the law moved Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October—a change that proved deeply unpopular.

By 1979, under pressure from veterans' organizations and state governments, the holiday was returned to its original date, November 11, where it remains today.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Why Didn’t Washington’s Birthday Become Presidents’ Day?</strong></h3>
During discussions on the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Representative McClory, a native of Illinois (the Land of Lincoln), proposed renaming Washington’s Birthday to Presidents’ Day to also honor Abraham Lincoln, who was born on February 12. However, this idea faced strong opposition from Virginia lawmakers, who fought to keep Washington’s name intact.

As a result, while some states—including California, Illinois, and New York—chose to officially recognize Lincoln’s birthday, it did not become a federal holiday.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Retailers Create Presidents’ Day</strong></h3>
Despite the government keeping Washington’s Birthday as the official name, retailers saw an opportunity for marketing. By the 1980s, businesses began promoting "Presidents' Day Sales" over the long weekend, leading many Americans to assume the holiday had been renamed to honor both Washington and Lincoln.

Over time, this perception solidified, and by the 1990s, the term "Presidents' Day" had become widely accepted across the country—even though, according to federal law, the holiday is still officially Washington’s Birthday.
<h3 class="western"><strong>What Is the Holiday Called Today?</strong></h3>
While the U.S. government still recognizes the holiday as Washington’s Birthday, individual states have adopted their own variations:
<ul>
 	<li>"Presidents' Day" is recognized in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota.</li>
 	<li>"Presidents’ Day" (with an apostrophe after "s") is observed in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.</li>
 	<li>"President’s Day" (singular) is used in Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of its name, the holiday remains a day to reflect on the legacy of America’s first president and, unofficially, to recognize the contributions of all U.S. presidents.
