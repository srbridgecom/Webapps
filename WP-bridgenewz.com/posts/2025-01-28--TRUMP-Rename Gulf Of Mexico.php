“<span style="font-size: large;"><b>RESTORING NAMES THAT HONOR AMERICAN GREATNESS “</b></span>

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Why? Gulf Of America, </b></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">President Trump announced a name change for the Gulf of Mexico, suggesting the updated name reflects the United States’ significant role and efforts in the region. Describing the decision as “appropriate,” Trump highlighted the historical and economic importance of the area to the nation. “We do most of the work there and it’s ours,”</span>

“<span style="font-size: medium;">The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning nation and has remained an indelible part of America,” a statement from the White House explained.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">The announcement underscored the Gulf’s prominence in U.S. geography and industry. “It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres,” the White House added.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Trump further emphasized the Gulf’s vital role in energy production, calling attention to its geology. “The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our nation’s crude oil production and an abundance of natural gas. It has consistently driven new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world,” he stated.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Reports indicate that organizations such as the U.S. Coast Guard and the State of Florida have already begun using the new name.</span>
<h3 class="western"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">The Gulf’s Economic Impact</span></strong></h3>
<span style="font-size: medium;">The Gulf region remains the largest offshore oil-producing area in the United States. According to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Gulf accounts for 97% of all U.S. offshore oil and gas production. It contributes approximately 14% of the nation’s crude oil production and 5% of its natural gas output.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">In refining, the Gulf plays an even greater role. The Energy Information Administration (EIA), a section of the Department of Energy, reports that the Gulf is home to over 48% of U.S. refining capacity and 51% of natural gas processing capacity.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">In 2023, crude oil production in the Gulf averaged 1.8 million barrels daily. The EIA projects that production will increase to 1.9 million barrels daily in 2024, maintaining the same rate through 2025. Natural gas production, however, is expected to decline. After averaging 2 billion cubic feet daily in 2023, production is forecasted to fall to 1.8 billion cubic feet daily in both 2024 and 2025.</span>
<h3 class="western"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Future Production Prospects</span></strong></h3>
<span style="font-size: medium;">The EIA noted in its Gulf report that 12 new fields are expected to begin production in 2024 and 2025. These new fields will contribute significantly to maintaining oil and gas production in the region, with additional output projected to exceed 200,000 barrels daily. Without these new developments, the EIA warned, production in the Gulf would face a decline.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">The Gulf continues to be a cornerstone of U.S. energy production, innovation, and refining capacity. With this name change, the administration aims to underscore the region’s enduring value to the nation’s economy and energy independence.</span>

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>EXECUTIVE ORDER STATES: </b></span>

“<span style="font-size: large;"><b>RESTORING NAMES THAT HONOR AMERICAN GREATNESS”</b></span>

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>EXECUTIVE ORDER </b></span>

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>JANUARY 20TH, 2025</b></span>

“<span style="font-size: medium;">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes.  The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past. </span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sec. 2.  Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.  (a)  Within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(c)  With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(d)  Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sec. 3.  Renaming of Mount McKinley.  (a)  President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.  Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.  President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.  He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">In 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America’s highest peak.  Yet after nearly a century, President Obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">This order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name “Mount McKinley.”  The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.  The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sec. 4.  Gulf of America.  (a)  The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.  The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce.  It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.  Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today.  The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.  The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.  The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.  Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.  The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(b)  As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the “Gulf of America” the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.  The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.  The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sec. 5.  Additional Action.  The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</span>
