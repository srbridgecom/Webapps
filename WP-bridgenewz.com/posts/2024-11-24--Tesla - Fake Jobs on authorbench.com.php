<p>I was job hunting, a friend of mine who works for Tesla told me to check them out. I came across this site and thought it was REAL!<br /><br /><strong>https://remote-jobs-uk.authorbench.com</strong> <br /><br />Don't worry, I didn't make the site a clickable link. to break down the URL, the site is named <strong>authorbench.com</strong> and the subsite or sub domain as it's properly called is <strong>remote-jobs-uk</strong>.</p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>All jobs from Tesla, will come from a direct Tesla Company website. tesla.om/careers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Pay rate is really high at $38 - $48 Per Hour for an entry level position in the USA. Usually entry level customer service jobs will pay minimum wage to $16 per hour (based on which U.S. State you live in and it's current minimum wage amount).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The listing and website is claimed to be owned by a company called "Remote Jobs in USA" as you can see from the footer. Usually, legit websites have the proper company name listed.... "tesla.com or Tesla"</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The site is built with a theme from GeneratePress; any real company like Tesla will have their own custom built websites.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Most important, when you click on apply, the submit button just SPINS like a non-stop, time wasting revolving door.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Site is just another Data Collection, fake jobs, ghost jobs site. Seeking traffic for ad generation or to log your data for resale.</strong><br /><br />TRULY, if you wish to apply for a job with someone, look for these patterns, apply directly on the company website. You can even search the site name on web, in your fav search engine to see what others are saying.</p>
