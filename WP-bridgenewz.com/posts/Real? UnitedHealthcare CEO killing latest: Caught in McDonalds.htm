Real? UnitedHealthcare CEO killing latest: Caught in McDonalds!

I am not for or supporting the crime involved. I am simply, informing everyone of events! You may think..... is this a setup? After murdering a wealthy top CEO, you flew of course, but to retain the same murder weapon and other evidence? Luigi was asking to get caught! Anyone one of intelligence will know the classic tale of, you escape, run, travel, leave the country, ditch the evidence and vanish. Or so we would think.

Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Maryland native and Ivy League graduate, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the December 4 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan. Arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Mangione was found with handwritten notes expressing frustration with the U.S. healthcare system and disdain for corporate America, mentioning UnitedHealthcare specifically. Police also recovered a 3D-printed "ghost gun" with a suppressor and fake identification linking Mangione to a New York hostel near the crime scene.

Mangione’s capture was aided by public tips after his photo was widely circulated, leading to his identification at a McDonald’s. The NYPD confirmed forensic evidence, including DNA and fingerprints, to connect him to the crime. Mangione faces multiple charges in both New York and Pennsylvania, including weapons possession and forgery. His family expressed shock at his arrest and extended condolences to Thompson’s family. Authorities continue investigating Mangione’s movements across the U.S. and abroad.
