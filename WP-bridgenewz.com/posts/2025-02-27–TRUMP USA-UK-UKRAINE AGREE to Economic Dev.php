President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to travel to Washington, D.C. in the coming days following an agreement between Ukraine and the United States on a deal involving natural resources and reconstruction efforts, according to a Ukrainian official.

Negotiations over the deal have been ongoing for several days, focusing on granting the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as part of broader discussions aimed at ending Russia’s invasion. Additionally, the agreement includes provisions for U.S. involvement in a reconstruction fund for Ukraine.

The Ukrainian official noted that the terms were finalized after removing all unacceptable clauses, ensuring that the agreement clearly defines how it will contribute to Ukraine’s security and peace.

While the exact details of the agreement remain undisclosed, one of the most contentious issues was a demand from the Trump administration for a $500 billion stake in Ukraine’s rare earth minerals and other resources in exchange for the aid the U.S. had already provided. Zelensky had previously rejected this demand.

<strong>The U.S. has not yet confirmed whether the deal’s terms have been finalized.</strong>
<blockquote><strong>"I hear that (Zelensky is) coming on Friday. Certainly, it’s OK with me if he’d like to, and he would like to sign it together with me. And I understand that’s a big deal, very big deal," U.S. President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office on Tuesday.</strong></blockquote>
<strong>When asked what Ukraine would receive in the deal, Trump stated:</strong>
<blockquote><strong>"$350 billion and lots of equipment, military equipment, and the right to fight on."</strong></blockquote>
<strong>Trump added:</strong>
<blockquote><strong>"We’ve pretty much negotiated our deal on rare earth and various other things. We’ll be looking to future security for Ukraine later on. I don’t think that’s going to be a problem. I spoke with Russia about it. They didn’t seem to have a problem with it. So I think they understand … once we do this, they’re not going back in."</strong></blockquote>

<h2 class="western"><strong>Ukraine Pushes for Security Guarantees Amid Peace Talks</strong></h2>
Ukraine has been seeking security guarantees as part of a broader agreement, not only to regain lost territory but also to protect against potential future Russian invasions.

European leaders have echoed Kyiv’s demands, stressing the need for security guarantees as a prerequisite for any peace talks with Moscow. During his meeting with Trump on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron proposed enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities, including the possibility of deploying British and French troops to maintain peace if requested.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is set to visit the White House on Thursday, has emphasized the need for a U.S. "backstop" in any Ukraine peace deal. This could include security guarantees, American intelligence cooperation, air support, and heavy-lift transport.

Despite the apparent progress, sources indicate that the U.S. had initially resisted including security guarantees in the agreement’s draft. The exact wording regarding Ukraine’s security in the latest version of the agreement remains unclear.

However, recent developments suggest that both leaders are now moving closer to a final agreement.

During his White House visit on Monday, Macron praised Trump for his decision to collaborate with Zelensky on finalizing the agreement.
<blockquote>"I commend President Trump for his decision to work with President Zelensky, and to conclude this agreement that’s so important for the U.S. and Ukraine on rare earths and critical minerals," Macron said.</blockquote>

<h2 class="western"><strong>Russia Continues Airstrikes as Ukraine Negotiates Terms</strong></h2>
Even as Ukraine and the U.S. edge toward a significant agreement, Russia has continued its airstrikes across Ukraine.

According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia launched at least 177 drones targeting Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday. Ukrainian defense systems shot down 110 of the drones, while 66 failed to reach their intended targets.

At least seven people were killed in the overnight attacks, including two fatalities in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials reported Wednesday.

Despite ongoing peace talks and negotiations, the war continues, underscoring the urgency of securing military and economic aid for Ukraine in any future agreement.
