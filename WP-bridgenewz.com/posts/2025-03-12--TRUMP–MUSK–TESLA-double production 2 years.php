<h2 class="western"><strong>Musk Commits to Doubling Tesla’s U.S. Output</strong></h2>
Elon Musk has pledged to double Tesla's vehicle production in the United States within the next two years, citing President Donald Trump’s policies as a major reason for the expansion.
<blockquote>"It’s a function of the great policies of President Trump and his administration, as well as an act of faith in America," Musk said on Tuesday.</blockquote>
Standing beside Musk at the announcement, Trump patted him on the back, adding:
<blockquote>"It’s a big deal."</blockquote>
While Tesla's share price remained flat in after-hours trading, the company has lost more than 40% of its value this year, affected by weaker sales and investor concerns over Musk’s involvement in Trump’s administration.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Debunking the $1,000 Tesla Discount Claim</strong></h3>
Despite online claims, Trump is not offering a $1,000 discount on Tesla vehicles. This misinformation has been circulating but has no basis in any official policy or statement.

<h2 class="western"><strong>Tesla’s Current and Future Production Capacity</strong></h2>
Tesla's current U.S. production capacity is estimated at 700,000 vehicles per year, but Musk’s announcement suggests plans to reach 1.4 million units annually by 2026.

Tesla's actual production rate is much lower than installed capacity. In 2024:
<ul>
 	<li>Model S/X production was less than 50,000 units, despite a 100,000-unit capacity.</li>
 	<li>Model 3/Y production in the U.S. reached 600,000 units, short of its 800,000-unit capacity.</li>
 	<li>Cybertruck production remained under 50,000 units, below its 125,000-unit installed capacity.</li>
</ul>
Tesla currently outputs 700,000 vehicles per year in the U.S.—to double production, it must increase that number to 1.4 million per year.

<hr />

<h2 class="western"><strong>How Will Tesla Reach 1.4 Million U.S. Units?</strong></h2>
Musk’s doubling of production likely refers to actual vehicle output rather than installed capacity. Several key factors could contribute to this expansion:
<h3 class="western">1. Two New, More Affordable Models (200,000 Units)</h3>
Tesla has announced plans for two new lower-cost models in 2024.
<ul>
 	<li>These vehicles will be produced on the same lines as the Model 3 and Model Y.</li>
 	<li>They could add another 200,000 units per year, helping Tesla maximize its installed capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">2. Tesla Semi Production Expansion (50,000 Units)</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Tesla is developing its Nevada facility for the Tesla Semi electric truck.</li>
 	<li>Full-scale production is expected to begin in 2025.</li>
 	<li>Tesla has a target of 50,000 units per year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">3. Cybercab Robotaxi (450,000+ Units)</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Tesla’s Cybercab, a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, is expected to start production in Texas in 2026.</li>
 	<li>Musk has stated the Cybercab could have a production capacity of at least 2 million units per year, but this would require multiple factories.</li>
 	<li>To meet Musk’s U.S. production goals, Tesla would need to ramp up Cybercab output to at least 450,000 units per year.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 class="western"><strong>Tesla’s Expansion Was Planned Before Trump’s Policies</strong></h2>
While Musk attributes the expansion to Trump’s administration, it’s important to note that Tesla had these plans in motion before the U.S. elections or any new policies.

Tesla has been working toward:
<ul>
 	<li>Scaling production at Gigafactory Texas for new vehicle models.</li>
 	<li>Expanding Tesla Semi production in Nevada.</li>
 	<li>Developing the Cybercab platform as part of its long-term strategy.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of political influence, achieving 1.4 million U.S. units per year will be a massive challenge for Tesla. However, if successful, it could solidify Tesla’s position as the dominant EV manufacturer in the United States.

<hr />

<h3 class="western"><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3>
With Cybercab production set to begin in 2026, new affordable Tesla models in development, and the Tesla Semi ramp-up, the company is on an aggressive growth trajectory.

If Musk’s 1.4 million production target is met, it would mark one of the most significant expansions in Tesla’s history. Whether Tesla can achieve this remains to be seen, but the next two years will be critical for its success.
