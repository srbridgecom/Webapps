<span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Enough with the misinformation! Shame on you for spreading half-truths and leaving out critical facts. The headlines are plastered with claims of “$1 billion in food cuts to schools,” but let’s get to the truth: there are <strong>16 fully funded food programs</strong> still in place, <strong>five of which directly support schools</strong>. Do you really think President Trump would slash food for kids? Think again. Here’s the real story—read it, share it, and stop the lies.</span></span></span>
<h4 class="western"><span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The False Narrative: $1 Billion Cut to Schools?</b></span></span></span></h4>
The media and news outlets are screaming about a supposed $1 billion cut to school food programs. But here’s what they won’t tell you: the cut was to the <strong>Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)</strong>, not directly to school meals. According to the USDA itself, "CCC does not have any employees." So, are you seriously going to hand $1 billion to a corporation with no staff? Where the hell does that money go? Notice who’s complaining the loudest—mainly Democrats in politics. (Let’s be clear: this site and I are about <strong>truth</strong>, not political affiliation.) How many people are getting private kickbacks from this shadowy fund? That’s the real question.

<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #080809;">As you DIG into what the CCC has control of and has done, it gets worse. You start to feel, this doesn’t feel right:</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"The CCC Charter Act also grants the Secretary of Agriculture broad powers and discretion to use the CCC. " </span></span></span><a href="https://congress.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">congress.gov</span></span></span></a>

<span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">WTF? Tom Vilsack had access to all this money, whats his net worth?</span></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">THIS GUY actually stated, “he’s given his party a winning program, but they need to go out and sell it.” WHAT THE F!?!?!</span></span>

<h4 class="western"><span style="color: #080809;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The Truth: 16 Fully Funded Programs</b></span></span></span></h4>
Despite the CCC cut, <strong>16 programs remain fully funded</strong>—yes, <strong>FULLY FUNDED</strong>—and they’re ready to support communities, including kids in schools. Here’s the list:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FOR SCHOOLS)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>National School Lunch Program (FOR SCHOOLS)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>School Breakfast Program (FOR SCHOOLS)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Special Milk Program (FOR SCHOOLS)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Summer Food Service Program (FOR KIDS AND TEENS AT SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS)</strong></li>
 	<li>Sun Bucks EBT (Auto $120 per kid for groceries, can be added on top of SNAP/EBT)</li>
 	<li>Commodity Supplemental Food Program (for low income)</li>
 	<li>Food Distribution on Native American Reservations</li>
 	<li>Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)</li>
 	<li>Disaster Assistance</li>
 	<li>Child and Adult Care</li>
 	<li>Farmers Market Program</li>
 	<li>Senior Farmers Market Program</li>
 	<li>Nutrition Assistance Program</li>
 	<li>SNAP</li>
 	<li>WIC</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

That’s right—<strong>five of these programs are specifically for schools</strong>, ensuring kids don’t go hungry. The $1 billion CCC cut doesn’t touch these. So why the hysteria? Let’s dig into what some of these programs actually do.
<h4 class="western">Spotlight on 5 Fully Funded School Programs</h4>
Here’s a closer look at five of the fully funded programs supporting schools, straight from the facts:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP)</strong>
This program provides free fresh fruits and vegetables to elementary school kids during the school day. It’s designed to boost healthy eating habits and fight childhood obesity. Schools in low-income areas get priority, and it’s fully funded to keep kids nourished and learning.</li>
 	<li><strong>National School Lunch Program (NSLP)</strong>
The NSLP serves millions of kids affordable, nutritious lunches every school day. It’s a cornerstone of school nutrition, offering free or reduced-price meals to eligible students. Funding? Intact and rolling strong.</li>
 	<li><strong>School Breakfast Program (SBP)</strong>
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and the SBP ensures kids start their mornings right with healthy options. Like the NSLP, it’s fully funded and targets kids who might otherwise skip breakfast, especially in low-income families.</li>
 	<li><strong>Special Milk Program (SMP)</strong>
Got milk? This program does. It provides milk to kids in schools and childcare settings that don’t participate in other federal meal programs. It’s a simple, effective way to get calcium and nutrients to growing bodies—fully funded, no cuts here.</li>
 	<li><strong>Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)</strong>
When school’s out, hunger doesn’t stop. The SFSP keeps kids and teens fed during summer break, serving meals at schools, parks, and community sites. It’s fully funded to bridge the gap for kids who rely on school meals year-round.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="western">Why the Misinformation?</h4>
The media’s obsession with the CCC cut ignores these thriving programs. The CCC might be a New Deal-era relic, but cutting its $1 billion doesn’t starve kids—it just trims a faceless fund. Meanwhile, these 16 programs are doing the real work. So, news outlets, do your job: report the full story. How many people are profiting off the CCC while kids still get fed through these other channels? Follow the money.
<h4 class="western">Final Word</h4>
There you have it—16 fully funded programs, five directly for schools, regardless of the CCC cut. The truth is out there if you stop swallowing the headlines. Share this, call out the lies, and let’s hold the media accountable. Kids aren’t going hungry on Trump’s watch, and these programs prove it.
