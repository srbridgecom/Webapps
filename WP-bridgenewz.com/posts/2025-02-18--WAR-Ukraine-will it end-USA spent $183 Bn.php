<h3 class="western"><strong>Congress Allocates Billions for Ukraine Aid</strong></h3>
Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, Congress approved $174.2 billion through five Ukraine supplemental appropriation acts. Of this amount, $163.6 billion was designated for Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR) and the broader Ukraine response. Additionally, $18.2 billion was allocated from annual agency appropriations, while $1.1 billion came from other supplemental appropriation acts.
<h3 class="western"><strong>High-Level U.S.-Russia Talks in Focus</strong></h3>
Following a high-level meeting between U.S. and Russian officials, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with The Associated Press, emphasizing that both sides broadly agreed to pursue three main goals:
<ol>
 	<li>Restoring staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow.</li>
 	<li>Creating a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks.</li>
 	<li>Exploring closer diplomatic and economic cooperation.</li>
</ol>
Rubio clarified that while the talks—attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other senior officials—marked an important first step, significant work remains.

Lavrov echoed Rubio’s sentiments, describing the discussion as “very useful.” He added, “We not only listened but also heard each other.”
<h3 class="western"><strong>Ukraine Left Out of Peace Talks</strong></h3>
Notably, no Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting. The absence of Kyiv’s representation was particularly striking given that Ukraine continues to lose ground against Russian forces in the ongoing war, now approaching its third year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy swiftly rejected any potential outcome from the talks, stating that Kyiv would not accept decisions made without its participation. In response, Zelenskyy also postponed his scheduled trip to the kingdom, originally planned for Wednesday.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Strained U.S.-Russia Relations and the Path Forward</strong></h3>
Relations between Washington and Moscow have reached their lowest point in decades, with tensions worsening since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and further escalating after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In response to Russia’s aggression, the U.S. and European nations imposed extensive sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy. The diplomatic fallout has led to mass expulsions of diplomats and increased restrictions on embassies in both capitals.

Despite these challenges, Rubio suggested that ending the war in Ukraine could unlock new geopolitical and economic opportunities for U.S.-Russia relations. He stated,
<blockquote>“Ending the war in Ukraine could unlock the door for incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians geopolitically on issues of common interest and, frankly, economically on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.”</blockquote>
His remarks highlight a significant shift in U.S. policy, contrasting with the approach of former President Joe Biden, who spearheaded international efforts to isolate Moscow.
<h3 class="western"><strong>Trump-Putin Summit in the Works</strong></h3>
The U.S.-Russia talks were also seen as a stepping stone for a potential summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, no date has been set for the meeting.

Yuri Ushakov, a senior Russian official, told Russian television that a summit was unlikely to take place next week. Meanwhile, U.S. Representative Michael Waltz suggested it could be arranged in the coming weeks.

Speaking after the meeting, Lavrov reiterated the three key objectives outlined by Rubio and announced that both nations would appoint representatives to conduct regular consultations on Ukraine. He added,
<blockquote><strong>“I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position.”</strong></blockquote>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Most Extensive U.S.-Russia Contact Since 2022 Invasion</strong></h3>
The meeting marked the most extensive diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.

Previously, the only notable interaction between the two governments occurred when then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Lavrov spoke briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 summit in India nearly two years ago—an exchange that did little to ease tensions.

Reflecting on the recent discussions, a senior U.S. official, Witkoff, described the meeting as “positive, upbeat, and constructive.” He noted that all participants were committed to achieving a meaningful resolution.

While these talks represent a shift in U.S.-Russia engagement, the path to peace remains uncertain, especially given Ukraine’s exclusion from the negotiations.
