<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Nvidia has pledged up to $500 billion to build cutting-edge plants in Texas and Arizona, a move President Trump is hailing as a triumph of his push for an American manufacturing renaissance. With an initial $100 billion investment, Nvidia aims to produce AI chips and supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time in its history, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and driving trillions in economic security. Here’s how it’s unfolding and why it matters.</span></span></span>
<h4 class="western">The Plan: AI Powerhouses in Texas and Arizona</h4>
Nvidia’s bold commitment includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Over one million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips, with production already started at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) plants in Phoenix.</li>
 	<li>Supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas, to power AI factories—a new breed of data centers designed solely for artificial intelligence processing.</li>
 	<li>Partnerships with Taiwan-based SPIL and Amkor for packaging and testing operations in Arizona.</li>
</ul>
The tech giant projects this $100 billion initial investment could soar to $500 billion over four years, creating AI infrastructure worth up to half a trillion dollars. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.”
<h4 class="western">Trump’s Role: The “Trump Effect”</h4>
The White House is calling this “the Trump Effect in action”, crediting Trump’s focus on U.S.-based chip manufacturing. “Trump has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said in a statement Monday.

This follows Trump’s earlier announcement of a $500 billion joint venture for AI infrastructure through Stargate, a partnership of OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. Tasked with building data centers and electricity generation for AI in Texas, Stargate’s initial $100 billion could scale to $500 billion, aligning with Nvidia’s pledge.
<h4 class="western">Timeline and Impact</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Blackwell production has already kicked off in Phoenix, Arizona, at TSMC plants.</li>
 	<li>Mass production at both Texas and Arizona facilities is set to ramp up in the next 12-15 months.</li>
 	<li>The plants will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over decades, Nvidia said, by powering AI factories that redefine data processing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="western">The Bigger Picture: Tariffs and Tech</h4>
Nvidia’s announcement comes as the Trump administration navigates tariff policies. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday: “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” While smartphones and laptops enjoy a temporary tariff reprieve, a new semiconductor tariff approach is in the works, potentially shaping Nvidia’s operations.
<h4 class="western">Why It Matters</h4>
Nvidia’s move isn’t just about chips—it’s a bet on America’s tech future. By bringing AI chip and supercomputer production stateside, Nvidia strengthens the U.S. supply chain and resiliency, meeting skyrocketing global demand. Trump’s taking credit, tying it to his broader vision of “trillions” in tech investment. Will it spark the renaissance he promises, or face tariff-driven hurdles? The stakes are high.
