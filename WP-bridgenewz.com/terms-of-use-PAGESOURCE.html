<p><strong>6. Subscription Terms.</strong></p>
<p>These Subscription Terms set forth in this Section govern your use and access to subscription content on BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, (the “Subscription Content”).</p>
<p>To access Subscription Content, you must have an Account, and you must have an active subscription plan (a “<strong>Subscription</strong>”) with a valid payment method (a “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”).</p>
<p>(A) Purchasing a Subscription. By purchasing a Subscription, you expressly acknowledge and agree that (1) we (or our third-party payment processor) (the “<strong>Payment Service</strong>”), are authorized to charge your Payment Method. By providing a Payment Method to us, you agree that we and/or our Payment Service are authorized to periodically charge the applicable Subscription fee together with any applicable taxes and service fees (collectively, the “<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>”) on a recurring basis until you duly cancel your Subscription. We and/or our Payment Service will attempt to verify the Payment Method you provide, and may do this by processing an authorization hold, which is a standard practice. If your Payment Method expires and you do not update your Payment Method or duly cancel your Subscription before it automatically renews, you authorize us and/or our Payment Service to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a valid Payment Method is not available when a payment becomes due, we may restrict, suspend or cancel your Subscription due to lack of payment.</p>
<p>(B) Ongoing Subscription and Billing Cycle. The Subscription Fee will be billed at the time you establish your Subscription and on an ongoing basis at the intervals specified when you complete your Subscription purchase unless you cancel your Subscription prior to your Subscription renewal. Please note that the length of your billing cycle will vary based upon the Subscription plan you choose when you subscribe. The timing of your billing may change in the event of a problem with your Payment Method (e.g., an expired credit card), in the event you change your Subscription plan or where you start your Subscription on a day not contained in a subsequent month. You can go to the “Subscription” section in your settings to see your next billing date.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Subscription Price Changes</strong></p>
<p>We may change the Subscription Fee for any Subscription plan at any time and will communicate any price changes to you in accordance with applicable law. Your continuation of your subscription to the service after such notice has been delivered to you will constitute your acceptance of such price changes, unless you cancel your Subscription in accordance with these Subscription Terms.</p>
<p>(D) No Refunds. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION; NOR DO WE PROVIDE CREDIT, REFUNDS, OR PRORATED BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT ARE CANCELED. Even if you cancel your Subscription before the end of your active billing period, as applicable, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Subscription Fees for the remainder of that billing period. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to the Subscription Content until the end of the then-current billing period. We may choose to offer refunds, discounts or other consideration as a discretionary accommodation. However, each circumstance is unique and our election to make such an offer in one instance does not create the obligation to do so in another.</p>
<p>(F) Canceling Your Subscription. YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT THROUGH THE END OF THE BILLING PERIOD YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT LEAST ONE DAY BEFORE IT RENEWS IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED FOR THE NEXT CYCLE’S SUBSCRIPTION FEE. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your <a href="https://www.cnn.com/account/settings">account settings</a> by clicking “manage subscription”. If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of your then-current billing period and you will have continued access to your Subscription until the end of that period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID. You acknowledge and agree that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to your Subscription, including the Subscription Content, Subscription Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the Subscription Terms or any changes thereto; or any other policies or practices that apply to the Subscription.</p>
<p>(G) Changing Your Account Information. Should you wish to change your name or display name associated with your Subscription, you may do so within your Settings when logged into your Account.</p>
<p>(H) Multiple Billing Options and Plan Switching. You may be offered multiple Subscription billing options to access the Subscription Content. The pricing and offers for Subscriptions may change over time without notice (except as may be required by applicable law). Over time, each Subscription billing plan may offer different Subscription Content availability, functionality, features, device compatibility or have certain conditions or limitations, which will be disclosed during your sign-up or in other materials available on the Site. Subject to availability, if you have purchased a Subscription and would like to make change to a different billing frequency, you will need to log into your Account. You can change your subscription frequency by clicking “Manage” in the “Subscriptions” section of your Settings. Additional terms applicable to the switching of a Subscription plan (such as the applicable charges and changes to billing dates) will be provided at the time of your plan switch.</p>
<p>(I) Updating Your Payment Method. You may update your Payment Method at any time by accessing your Account and clicking “Edit” in the “Subscriptions” section of your Settings. A change in your Payment Method may result in changes to your prior billing cycle. It is your responsibility to update and maintain the Payment Method associated with your Subscription Fee. Please note, for certain Payment Methods, the relevant issuer may charge you certain fees, such as transactional fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Taxes and charges may also be applied and may vary depending on the Payment Method used. You will be solely responsible for any such taxes and charges that may apply.</p>
<p>(J) Unpaid Amounts. You are responsible for all charges incurred in connection with your Subscription. If your Payment Method is declined due to insufficient funds, expired or invalid account details, or for any other reason, and we are unable to process your Subscription Fee for your current billing period, (1) you will remain responsible for all such amounts, as well as any costs that we incur in collecting any amounts you fail to pay for access to the Subscription Content, including attorney and collection fees; (2) you authorize BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described in the Account Information section; and (3) BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may suspend or terminate your Subscription until such time as your Payment Method has been updated and the Subscription Fee is duly paid. You may lose the benefit of any Promotional Offer in the event your Payment Method on file with us fails to cover the Subscription Fee. Except as specified in Section 13, you will remain liable for all amounts and all costs incurred to collect these amounts, such as bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorney’s fees and arbitration costs.</p>
<p>(K) Free Trials and Promotional Offers. From time to time, we may make certain Subscription plans on the Site available to you on a free trial basis for a limited time (each, a “Trial Subscription”). The duration of each Trial Subscription will be specified at sign-up. Trial Subscriptions are limited to new subscribers, unless otherwise specified. Your status as a new subscriber will be determined by us.</p>
<p>At the time of signing up for a Trial Subscription, you must provide a valid Payment Method in order to access the Subscription Content during the Trial Subscription period. Your Payment Method will not be charged during the Trial Subscription period.</p>
<p>UNLESS YOU TIMELY CANCEL YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL, YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONVERT TO A PAID SUBSCRIPTION AT THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL, AND THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE WILL BE CHARGED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.</p>
<p>In addition, from time to time, we may make certain Subscription plans available to you on a discounted basis or in conjunction with a promotion (each, a “Promotional Offer”). If we provide you with a Promotional Offer, you must provide a valid Payment Method in order to access the Subscription Content during the Promotional Period. Promotional Offers may take a variety of forms and may be available on a standalone basis or provided as part of a bundle with other products or services.</p>
<p>In the event of a new/subsequent Promotional Offer after you sign-up for a Subscription, no refunds, adjustments or price protection will be applied to your Subscription Fee. Customers may take advantage of any “new customer” promotion only once. Requirements for a special promotion will be stated at the time each offer is presented. You agree not to register multiple times for the same Promotional Offer using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means. Any such action shall constitute a violation of these Terms and may result in the termination of your Subscription.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for any Free Trial or Promotional Offer. In each case, after your Trial Subscription or Promotional Offer period ends, your Subscription will convert to a paid Subscription, and the Payment Service will begin billing your Payment Method for your Subscription at the then-current Subscription Fee unless you cancel before the offer period ends. You may not be notified that your Trial Subscription or Promotional Offer is about to end unless such notice is required by applicable law.</p>

<p>Any and all disputes, claims and controversies arising out of or in connection with your access to, and/or use of the Sites, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Sites shall be governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the laws and decisions of applicable to contracts made, entered into and performed entirely therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions, except to the extent that law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law. Any dispute that is not subject to arbitration under Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) of this Agreement, or any issues involving arbitrability or enforcement of provisions under Section 12, shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court of BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company location; and we both irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts for the adjudication of all non-arbitral claims.</p>
<p><strong>12. Severability. </strong></p>
<p>Except as specified in Section 12 (Dispute Resolution), if any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable for this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein.</p>
<p><strong>13. Dispute Resolution. </strong></p>
<p>We endeavor to resolve customer concerns as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>In the unlikely event that you’re not satisfied with customer service’s solution, and you and </strong><strong>BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company,</strong><strong> are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. </strong></p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong> In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court.</p>
<p><strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT </strong></p>
<p>(1) <strong>Claims Subject to Arbitration</strong>: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims</strong> between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</p>
<p>• claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</p>
<p>• claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;</p>
<p>• claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</p>
<p>• claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>References to “BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company,,” “you,” “we” and “us” in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates; those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</strong> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures</strong>: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). A Notice from you to BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, must be emailed (“<strong>Notice Address</strong>”).<br />
Any Notice must include (i) the claimant’s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person’s dispute.</p>
<p>After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).</p>
<p>Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Subsection 12.2. All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Arbitration Procedure: </strong>The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration &amp; Mediation (“NAM”) (“NAM Rules”)), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §5.) The NAM Rules are available online at <a href="http://www.namadr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.namadr.com</a>, by calling NAM, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration.</p>
<p>You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 12.2 and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).</p>
<p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except as to issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration (including whether a dispute is subject to this Arbitration Agreement or a previous arbitration provision between you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company,), which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.</p>
<p>Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator’s decision is binding only between you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator’s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</p>
<p>As in court, you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose.<br />
The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.</p>
<p>Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys’ fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>(4) <strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>(6) <strong>Offer of Settlement</strong>: In any arbitration between you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party’s favor and is less than the defending party’s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party’s favor, the other party must pay the defending party’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.</p>
<p>(7) <strong>Requirement of Individualized Relief</strong>: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. <strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING</strong>. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, will be subject to this Section 12 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company,, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 12 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company,, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>(8) <strong>Opt Out of Future Changes</strong>: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, an email within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; and (v) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.</p>
<p>(9) <strong>Mass Filing</strong>:</p>
<p>If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (“Mass Filing”) set forth in NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 12.2, until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Stage One</strong>: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, shall not pay the mediator’s fee.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Two</strong>:  If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, shall not pay the mediator’s fee.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Three</strong>: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.</p>
<p>If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:</p>
<p><strong>Option One:</strong> You and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with the Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by sending BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, an email. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>Option Two</strong>: If neither you nor BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.</p>
<p>A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement.</p>
<p>You and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.</p>
<p>(10) <strong>Severability</strong>: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.</p>
<p><strong>14. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER </strong></p>
<p>You and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding.  This means that you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim.  This also means that you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, may participate in a class-wide settlement.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
<p><strong>15. Miscellaneous. </strong></p>

The enforceable sections of these Terms of Use will remain binding upon the parties. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.</p>
<p>Neither BridgeNewz/us and it’s owners and or parent company, nor you shall be liable for damages or for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts or occurrences beyond their reasonable control, including, without limitation: fire, lightning, explosion, power surge or failure, water, acts of God, war, terrorism, revolution, civil commotion or acts of civil or military authorities or public enemies: any law, order, regulation, ordinance, or requirement of any government or legal body or any representative of any such government or legal body; or labor unrest, including without limitation, strikes, slowdowns, picketing, or boycotts; inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy shortages, or acts or omissions of other common carriers.</p>
